A proposed cab-sharing platform for NITC Students
This idea is about making a web-app, which integrates both the taxi drivers as well as the students into one single platform, thus providing a hassle-free cab booking experience.
Attached webpages are the intended front-end developments we wish to implement.


Since the idea is not commercially running yet, we are not able to host it as a website and purchase a domain, hence, the data (if entered) is stored in the local console itself. The proposed plan is to store all the data (both students and drivers) into a common cloud server and apply the matching algorithm (given in the report) by fecthing the data from there. In such a way, the web app can handle real-time requests properly.
